# Project 2: Simulate the Pool Table

Develop a simulation of 2D version of the pool table in one process, and then an Open MPI parallelized version. 

## Usage

```
Usage: pool <specfile > <ppmfile > [np]

  <specfile > path to specification file
  <ppmfile > output path to ppm file (without file extension)
  [np] number of processes or regions. Only for the sequential verison and should be a perfect square.
```
